Task 1.
Design, and implement, a scalable, cloud native, web-application which acts as a
video distribution website which facilitates sharing of Photos. This application would
conceptually be similar to sites such as Instagram.
Ideally, this would enable the following:
Model “creator” user accounts which may exclusively upload videos to the service;
through a dedicated creator view.
This includes setting metadata such as Title, Caption, Location and people present.
No public interface needs to be offered for enrolment of “creator” users.
Enable consumer users to use the service with a dedicated consumer view.
Consumer users should be able to view/search through image content, view image
and comment/rate image. These accounts will not be able to upload image content.
Ideally, this solution would integrate the following:
• Static HTML hosting of content of a web page which interacts with a web
backed through REST calls.
• Hosting of a REST endpoint which provides service logic and connections to
all necessary elements such as storage.
• Provide persistence of user data through scalable hosted databases and/or
block/object storage.
• Cater for user identities and roles using standard authentication mechanisms
and user access controls as appropriate for the cloud platform.
• Provide scalability mechanisms through appropriate caching and dynamic
DNS routing.
• Additionally, media conversion services may be used, be aware of the
limitations of the free tier services and potential costings.
Task 2.
Implement, deploy, and test the solution designed in task 1. This should be
implemented and deployed using the cloud platform explored within the practical
exercises associated with this module.
Task 3.
Provide a slide deck which details the developed solution; this slide deck will contain
an embedded video where the student provides:
A 5-minute presentation of the developed, tested and deployed solution. This should
focus on the operation of the solution, showing changes and activity on the backend
systems.
During this exercise, the student will have demonstrated self-direction and originality
in problem solving, acting autonomously in planning and executing this task at a
professional level.
Additionally, the student will apply technical expertise effectively and will adapt skills
previously learnt in conjunction with designing and/or developing new skills or
procedures for new situations.
N.B. The students are required to implement this solution using the cloud platform
which was the focus of the teaching materials.
Once the solution is produced, students are required to produce presentation which
incorporates a 5-minute video capture demonstrating the solution.
In the presentation It is recommended to have circa 12 content slides which follow
the below outline:
Slide 0. Title Slide. Project name, one line description. Student name, Student
number.
Slides 1 - 2. Discussion of the problem and identification of the issues related
to scalability.
Slides 3 - 6. Overview of the technical solution developed.
Slides 7 - 8. An overview of advanced features within the developed solution
Slides 9 - 10. An assessment of limitations of the solution and evaluation of its
ability to scale.
Slide 11. Functionality of the recorded demonstration (15%) [5-minute video].
This needs to showcase the functionality of the solution and show its
deployment to Azure.
Slide 12. Concluding comments.
Slide 13. References.
Slides should be produced in the PowerPoint format and will need to be uploaded to
the relevant assessment area on blackboard. The following penalties will be
applicable to the duration of the video presentation according to the university roles.
Time Penalties: These deductions are from rubric section ‘Video Quality and
Presentation’
Within 5 mins – No penalty
> 30sec and < 1min – 10% deduction
>1min and above – 20% deduction
